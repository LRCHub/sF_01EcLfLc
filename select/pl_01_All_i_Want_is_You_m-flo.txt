君が忘れた腕時計見つめながら
最後に口にした言葉思い出してる
もしかしたら自分のせいかもしれないけど
つよがりな私のこと
許してくれるから
Baby all I want is you,
all I want is you また涙がこぼれそうになる
All I want is you,
all I want is you, you're my everything
出て行く君のことを止めず
ただ心残りな今は...
Baby all I want is you,
all I want is you, all I want is you
I feel like an ASTRONAUT
きもちは in the SKY
Way beyond the CLOUDS above
Way above and I'm not from
HOUSTON 出身でもないのに
we used to RAP-A-LOT
YOU＆I はいつか...
いつか...なんて思い...
Rock Rock the night away
Cuz I-I don't really wanna
Talk Talk 触れて欲しくない
ないこともある
Don't fight this feeling 今日は
Good night 一夜だけ
Let me forget forget
about you 忘れられない
about you
二人でふざけてた頃の動画みても
やりなおせる訳じゃないけど
忘れたくもないはち切れそうな heart and soul
いまさら願うよ叶わないのに
one last thing, やりなおせるなら
Baby all I want is you,
all I want is you 今もその声聞きたくなる
All I want is you,
all I want is you, I'll do anything
色褪せてくキミとの memories
もうキミの肌に触れられない
Baby all I want is you,
all I want is you, all I want is you
Someone, someone, Someone like you
Someone, someone, Someone like you
Only if I can... buy that time
back I'd find, I'd find you and
I'd find some ways to hold you back...back...
Only if I can... buy that time
back I'd find, I'd find you and
I'd find some ways to hold you back...back...
Baby all I want is you,
all I want is you また涙がこぼれそうになる
All I want is you,
all I want is you, you're my everything
この世の中どこ探しても
あの「時」は取り戻せない
Baby all I want is you,
all I want is you, all I want is you
I heard you're happy
with another girl and that you
were never looking back
wish I can say the same and live my life
でも今は一人きり
