You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold,
You say you want your story to remain untold
But all the promises we've made from the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You say you'll give me a highway with no-one on it,
Treasure just to look upon it,
All the riches in the night,
You say you'll give me,
Eyes in a moon of blindness,
A river in a time of dryness,
A hover in the temptness,
But all the promises we've made from the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You say you want your love to work out right,
To last with me through the night,
You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold,
Your story to remain untold,
Your love not to grow cold,
All the promises we've made from the cradle to the grave,
When all I want is you, is you, you.
